Math480-FinalProject
====================

My partner for the final project is Melissa Jones. We plan to write a program to solve linear optimization problems (Dantzig
simplex algorithm). Our code will output a graph of the polyherdron of the problem along with the highlighted maximum or
minimum to the problem. In addition we will output the final matrix of the problem along with the max/min value and the 
variables that arrive at the max/min value. Finally we will tell the user of our code, the method of solution (simplex 
via primal or dual or if the problem is unsolvable by these methods). Our code will address the problems that occur in 
linear programs that would require the need for a dual or augmentation. Our code will use the simplex method to solve 
either the primal or dual problem to the linear optimization.
